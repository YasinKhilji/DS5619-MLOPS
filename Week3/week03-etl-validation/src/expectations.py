"""
A minimal, from-scratch expectations framework in the spirit of Great
Expectations / data contracts (this week's lecture). You are implementing
the checking logic yourself rather than importing a library — the goal is
to understand what these tools actually do under the hood.

Fill in the four functions marked # TODO. Do not change the Violation
dataclass or any function signature.
